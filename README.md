# 🏬 Walmart Sales Prediction
📖 Overview

This project predicts weekly sales for Walmart stores across various departments using historical data, promotions, holidays, and economic indicators.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately forecasts sales and helps optimize business decisions 💰.

⚙️ Project Workflow

🧹 Data Preprocessing — Handle missing values, clean outliers, and merge related datasets.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Understand seasonal trends, holidays, and markdown impacts.

🧠 Model Building — Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

📊 Model Evaluation — Measure accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and WMAE (Weighted Mean Absolute Error).

📈 Predictions & Insights — Generate weekly sales predictions and analyze feature importance.
